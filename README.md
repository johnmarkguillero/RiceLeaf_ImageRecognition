# RiceLeaf_ImageRecognition

<h2>Rice Leaf Detection Philippines using Python and CNN </h2>

<h3>
  Introduction
Rice is a staple food in the Philippines, and ensuring its healthy growth is crucial. This project aims to detect diseases in rice leaves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Python. By leveraging image recognition techniques, we can identify various rice leaf diseases early, allowing for timely intervention and better crop management.

<h3>
  Model Training
The training script leverages a CNN architecture to learn and classify rice leaf diseases. You can adjust the hyperparameters and the model architecture in the src/model.py file.

Evaluation
The evaluation script provides metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance. Additionally, it generates confusion matrices and ROC curves for a detailed analysis.
